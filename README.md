This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged folders by week. There is also an an empty sandbox project that can be used to play around with any concept you would like.



Version control tracks changes to files over time, helping developers manage and collaborate on code efficiently. It's especially useful in software development where multiple people work on the same project.

Every change is recorded, showing who made what change, when, and why. This allows for easy reversion to earlier versions if something goes wrong or comparison of different code versions.

Version control enables collaboration, keeping projects organized and reducing errors. Developers can work on features in separate branches, merging them into the main codebase after review.

Git is a common tool, with basic commands like "git commit -m" saving changes with descriptive messages. This helps others understand the purpose of changes.

Version control maintains code quality, enables teamwork, and ensures smooth project evolution without losing track of progress.
